PetaLinux User Application Template
===================================

This directory contains a PetaLinux user library created from a template.

You can easily import any already built library by copying it into this
directory, and editing the automatically generated Makefile  as described below.

Modify the "build:" target Makefile to copy the library and/or the header files
to $(STAGEDIR) which is the sysroot used during compilation so that other user
lib/app can used this prebuilt one.

Modify the "install:" target in Makefile to use $(TARGETINST) to install your
prebuilt library to the host copy of the target file system referring to the
comments of the "install:" target.

Before building the library, you will need to enable the library from PetaLinux
menuconfig by running:
    "petalinux-config -c rootfs"
You will see your library in the "Libraries --->" submenu.

To install your prebuilt library to the target file system copy on the host,
simply run the
    "petalinux-build -c rootfs/libmisc"
command.

You will also need to rebuild PetaLinux bootable images so that the images
is updated with the updated target filesystem copy, run this command:
    "petalinux-build -x package"

You can also run one PetaLinux command to install the library to the
target filesystem host copy and update the bootable images as follows:
    "petalinux-build"
