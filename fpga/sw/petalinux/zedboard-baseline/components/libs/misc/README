PetaLinux User Library Template
===================================

This directory contains a PetaLinux user library created from a template.

If you are developing your library from scratch, simply start editing the
file libmisc.c.

You can easily import any existing library code by copying it into this 
directory, and editing the automatically generated Makefile as described below.

Before building the library, you will need to enable the library from
PetaLinux menuconfig by running:
    "petalinux-config -c rootfs"
You will see your library in the "Libraries --->" submenu.

To build your library, simply run the "petlainux-build -c rootfs/libmisc".
This command will build your library and will install your library into
the target file system host copy.

You will also need to rebuild PetaLinux bootable images so that the images
is updated with the updated target filesystem copy, run this command:
    "petalinux-build -x package"

You can also run one PetaLinux command to compile the library, install it
to the target filesystem host copy and update the bootable images as follows:
    "petalinux-build"

To add extra source code files (for example, to split a large library into 
multiple source files), add the relevant .o files to the list in the local 
Makefile where indicated.

To have other files (for example library configuration files or scripts) 
copied into the root file system, add addition lines under the "install:"
target in the Makefile.  For example

$(TARGETINST) myfile.conf /etc

	Copy the file myfile.conf from this directory into the /etc directory
	on the Embedded Linux filesystem)

$(TARGETINST) -a "some text here" /etc/system.conf
	
	Add the line "some text here" to the /etc/system.conf file.

See ${PETALINUX}/components/rootfs/targetroot-inst.sh for details and more options.
