Notes on ssendf.sh:
This is the SecureSendFile script:
It takes one argument: the file to encrypt and send, in the current directory
example: ./ssendf.sh test.json
The python script it runs should also be in the same directory, and this 
script requires PyCrypto to run
PyCrypto can be installed with pip or easyinstall

The python script also requires a public keyfile in the same directory, one can be generated, or just use the one provided for now, I'll also include the Decryption script and private key in
the test directory for testing purposes.


Notes on the Node.js server:
don't modify the file structure of the server
On my machine, the fup directory was inside /var/www, but it shouldn't need to be there
it can be run with 
	sudo nodejs fup.js
from inside the fup directory
It puts all uploaded files in the fup/uploads directory, where they are handled by 
decsend.sh
